# FIR Filter for Image Processing (FPGA - VHDL & Octave)

This repository provides an implementation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter for image processing. 
The project is developed using VHDL for FPGA deployment and Octave for simulation and validation.

## Credits
Special thanks to Marco Winzker (Professor) and FPGA Vision for their valuable insights and contributions to this project. 
Their expertise in FPGA design and image processing served as a foundation for this implementation.

## Overview
The FIR filter is designed to perform image processing operations such as smoothing, edge detection, or noise reduction. 
The project demonstrates how a digital filter can be simulated, tested, and implemented for real-time processing on an FPGA.

## Features

Octave Simulation: Analyze and verify filter characteristics (frequency response, impulse response) and apply filtering on test images.
FPGA Implementation: Efficient hardware implementation of the FIR filter for real-time image processing.

Configurable Parameters:
Filter coefficients.
Input image dimensions.
Bit precision for fixed-point arithmetic.
